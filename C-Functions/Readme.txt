In this section of my repo you can find code bits and pieces in C for everyday programming tasks with the AVR 8-bit RISC controllers (in this case an ATmega328 has been used):

- Ouput port config
- Input port config
- DOT matrix display functions
- Seconds counting
- ADC usage
- PWM
- ...

Feel free to use it!
